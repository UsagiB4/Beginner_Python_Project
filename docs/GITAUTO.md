Before we start, I just want to _THANK YOU_ for visiting my project. If you like it, leaving a _`STAR`_ will motivate me

1. First download the [git-automation.py](../git-automation.py) code.
2. To use it, put the code inside the folder that you want to push.
3. Remember, before using the tool, initialize you git repository and the folder, or you will get an `error`.
4. Now open CMD/ Terminal and type:
    ```
   git-automation.py <filename.extension> <comment>
   ```
   _e.g:_ git-automation.py myfile.txt "My file goes brrrr"
5. and done.
